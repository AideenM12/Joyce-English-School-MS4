### Python 
* All files were passed through the [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) validator and the results were all found to be PEP8 Compliant with the exception of the following four lines in the settings.py file:
    - line 145
    - line 148
    - line 151
    - line 154

These lines were auto generated by Django and left as found to maintain the integrity of the application.



## Manual Testing of Route Handlers
* In order to ensure each route handler performed correctly with regards to security features and defensive programming the following steps were taken to test each relevant route handler:
   1. Sign into Joyce English School as superuser.
   2. Navigate to the relevant pages that are user/superuser specific and copy the relevant url.
   3. Sign Out as superuser.
   4. Sign in as a standard user.
   5. Paste the relevant url into the google search bar.
   6. Check to see if the page redirects as anticipated. 
      * If the page redirects this confirms that the route handler is functioning as expected and no content from this page can be altered/deleted by anyone other than the content's owner or the site Admin.
      * If the page does not redirect as expected then the route handler has failed to protect the site's content and needs to be fixed. 

### Add Course Route Handler
* The above steps were implemented to test the add course route handler. As indicated by the image below, this route handler was functioning as expected at the time of submission by redirecting the user to the articles page and subsequently passed this test.

### Edit Course Route Handler
* The above steps were implemented to test the add course route handler. As indicated by the image below, this route handler was functioning as expected at the time of submission by redirecting the user to the articles page and subsequently passed this test.

* All delete functions do not display id specific urls at the time of deletion so similar tests could not be performed on these functions. However similar defensive programming has been implemented so as to prevent any malicious deletion of content and only allow content to be deleted by the the content's owner or the site admin.

## Known Bugs and Issues

* One issue during the start of development was the inability to render images in the browser. A 404 error was being display in the the terminal and after consultation with tutor support it was discovered that the following code needed to be added to the templates section of the settings.py file:

        'django.template.context_processors.media',

After this code was implemented 200 began displaying in the terminal with regard to the image however it still failed to display in the browser. After quick inspection with chrome dev tools it was discovered that the settings for the parallax image were with an opacity of 0, this issue was quickly rectified by applying an opacity of 1 to the parallax image in base.css.  

* Another issue noted during user testing was the failure of the checkbox to render on the remember me section of the login page. After extensive troubleshooting it was discovered that the checkbox firstly needed to be wrapped inside the label tags rather than underneath and whilst exploring the issue in devtools it was discovered that the checkout had a default opacity of 0 meaning it was not automatically visible. Several css rules were explored in order to target this issue but without changing the HTML format this issue could not be addressed because the HTML is hidden within an allauth form that was not accessible at the time of submission. This issue remains unresolved. A link to a stack overflow discussion about this particular issue can be found below:

- [Stack Overflow Materialize Checkbox](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49758284/checkbox-not-working-with-materializecss-html-css)


* Due to the fact that the cart can handle more than one model at a given time Tutor support was essential in assisting to figure out the logic to build the various cart views. All issues regarding the cart views were resolved after extensive troubleshooting and advice from tutor support. 

* During testing it was discovered that images weren't rendering on the 500 page despite the fact that the url path was identical to all other filepaths in the other templates. After some research the following code was applied:
```
<img src="{% get_media_prefix %}flag.jpg" alt="joyce-statue" width="640" height="640">
```

This solution was found through a Slack reference to the follow Django documentation:

- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/builtins/#get-media-prefix)

* During testing it was discovered that the original code configuation for the site's background images was causing HTML validation errors on several pages. The original code rendered the image by assigning it to a class in the body element and targeting the image inside the base.css. This resulted in validation errors because the body element was being referenced twice, first from the base template and then in the templates that used the background image body class. The solution to this issue was to create inline css in the individual templates that displayed a background image. This resolved the HTML validation issues and no further HTML issues were detected.

* During the later stages of development it was noted that there were some issues with regard to the checkout/checkout success functionality. The first issue that was noted was that prospective users were being charged double for a purchase. The second was that within the order history section it was revealed that two payments had appeared to have taken place, One with the correct price and one with the doubled price as seen in the images below:

**Checkout Price Double**

* <img src="documentation/doc_images/price-double.png" width="350" height="150" alt="double-price">

**Order History Duplicate Charge**

<img src="documentation/doc_images/double-order.png" width="350" height="150" alt="double-order">


After investigating Stripe webhooks it was discovered that the webhooks had two end points which was causing the duplicate charges. The unnecessary end point was disabled and this issue was resolved. 

After investigating the relevant views concerning checkout and payments it was discovered that an additional outer loop was causing the value of the payment to double. The code causing this problem was as follows: 
```
 if cart['courses']:
     for item_id, item_data in cart['courses'].items():
        order_line_item = OrderLineItem(
            order=order,
            course=Course.objects.get(pk=item_id),
            quantity=item_data,
             )
        order_line_item.save()
```

The for loop was removed and the current functioning code is as follows:
```
if cart['exam_courses']:
     for item_id, item_data in cart['exam_courses'].items():
        order_line_item = OrderLineItem(
            order=order,
            exam_course=ExamCourse.objects.get(pk=item_id),
            quantity=item_data,
            )
        order_line_item.save()
```
The code amendment solved the price doubling issue and the issue is now resolved.




## Further Testing

* Testing was performed in the following browsers on both laptop and mobile devices:
    - Google Chrome

    - Mozilla Firefox

    - Opera 

    - Microsoft Edge

    No issues were detected in any of these browsers at the time of submission.


    The below image is an example result of lighthouse testing performed on the index page for desktop with every other test achieving similar results. The lighthouse tool found in Google Dev Tools was used repeatedly throughout the building of the project and was essential in discovering and resolving the issues described in this document. A lighthouse test was performed on both mobile and desktop for each individual page on the site with links to the full reports of each of these tests found below. The lighthouse tool tested each of the following criteria: performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of each individual page in both mobile and desktop. Each test often resulted in a score of 90 or above with the lowest score being 70 for mobile performance, steps were taken to improve this score such as image compression but ultimately no further changes could be made without compromising the fidelity of the site's images or the site's frontend functionality.
