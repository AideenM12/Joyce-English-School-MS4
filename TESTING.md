## Linters



## Manual Testing of Route Handlers
* In order to ensure each route handler performed correctly with regards to security features and defensive programming the following steps were taken to test each relevant route handler:
   1. Sign into MotherFolklore as Admin.
   2. Navigate to the relevant pages that are user/Admin specific and copy the relevant url.
   3. Sign Out as Admin.
   4. Sign in as a standard user.
   5. Paste the relevant url into the google search bar.
   6. Check to see if the page redirects as anticipated. 
      * If the page redirects this confirms that the route handler is functioning as expected and no content from this page can be altered/deleted by anyone other than the content's owner or the site Admin.
      * If the page does not redirect as expected then the route handler has failed to protect the site's content and needs to be fixed. 

### Edit Article Route Handler

* All delete functions do not display id specific urls at the time of deletion so similar tests could not be performed on these functions. However similar defensive programming has been implemented so as to prevent any malicious deletion of content and only allow content to be deleted by the the content's owner or the site admin.

## Known Bugs and Issues

* One issue during the start of development was the inability to render images in the browser. A 404 error was being display in the the terminal and after consultation with tutor support it was discovered that the following code needed to be added to the templates section of the settings.py file:

        'django.template.context_processors.media',

After this code was implemented 200 began displaying in the terminal with regard to the image however it still failed to display in the browser. After quick inspection with chrome dev tools it was discovered that the settings for the parallax image were with an opacity of 0, this issue was quickly rectified by applying an opacity of 1 to the parallax image in base.css.  

## Further Testing

* Testing was performed in the following browsers on both laptop and mobile devices:
    - Google Chrome

    - Mozilla Firefox

    - Opera 

    - Microsoft Edge

    No issues were detected in any of these browsers at the time of submission.


    The below image is an example result of lighthouse testing performed on the index page for desktop with every other test achieving similar results. The lighthouse tool found in Google Dev Tools was used repeatedly throughout the building of the project and was essential in discovering and resolving the issues described in this document. A lighthouse test was performed on both mobile and desktop for each individual page on the site with links to the full reports of each of these tests found below. The lighthouse tool tested each of the following criteria: performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of each individual page in both mobile and desktop. Each test often resulted in a score of 90 or above with the lowest score being 80.
